## Overall Guidance

### Creating Organizations

Organizations should only be created via the portal.
The portal should be able to support the creation of multiple organizations to assist in creating the cloud service.

### Organizational Admins

**NB:** There are two types of admins.

**_Organizational Creator Admin (OCA)_** - The creator of the organization is more like a super admin. Ie, the creator is the only one with privilege to add or delete admins and delete organizations.
**_NB:_** OCA has every privilege an organizational admin has.

**_Organizational Admin_** - Added by the Creator. Has privilege to the rest of admin privilege.
