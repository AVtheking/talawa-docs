3. [Outreachy Ideas](./outreachy/ideas.md): Read about the interesting approaches required to make our software better for all stakeholders.
4. [GSoD Ideas](./gsod/ideas.md): High quality documentation is necessary for all our various participants from user, to developers and more. These ideas help to make our software more usable.
