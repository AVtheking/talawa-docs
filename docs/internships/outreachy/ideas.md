## Create How-to Guides, Walkthroughs and Troubleshooting Tips for the Talawa App

Creating How-to Guides, Walkthroughs, and Troubleshooting Tips for the Talawa app is an important step in improving the user experience and helping users navigate the Talawa more easily. Here are some steps you can follow to create these guides and tips:

1. **Identify common user issues**: Start by identifying common issues that users face while using the app. This can be done through user feedback, app reviews, or by analyzing user behavior within the app. Make a list of these issues, as this will be the basis for the guides and tips.

1. **Define the target audience**: Determine the target audience for the guides and tips. This will help you create content that is relevant and useful for the users. For example, if the app is aimed at beginners, create guides and tips that are easy to follow and understand.

1. **Create step-by-step guides**: Create step-by-step guides that walk users through specific tasks within the app. Use clear and concise language, and include screenshots or videos to make the process more visual. Keep the guides organized and easy to navigate, using headings and subheadings to break up the content.

1. **Create walkthroughs**: Walkthroughs are similar to guides but are more interactive. They provide users with a hands-on experience of how to use the app. Use animations, videos, and interactive elements to guide users through the app's features and functions.

1. **Create troubleshooting tips**: Troubleshooting tips help users solve common issues they may encounter while using the app. Create a list of common issues and provide step-by-step solutions to these problems. Use simple language and include screenshots or videos to make the process more visual.

1. **Test the guides and tips**: Once the guides and tips are created, test them with users to ensure that they are effective and easy to understand. Make any necessary revisions based on user feedback.

Publish the guides and tips: Once the guides and tips are finalized, publish them on the Talawa docs site. 

## Replacing Text with Symbols (Semiotics)

Talawa is aimed at underserved communities that may not be fully literate so replacing words with semiotics could be beneficial for that cause. We would have to use some form of A/B testing to see if the type of symbols that are used would be understood by the larger population. The following details how one would go about this approach:


1. **Define the target audience**: First, it's essential to identify the target audience. This will help in understanding the level of literacy and the type of semiotics that would be most appropriate.

1. **Identify the key features**: Once the target audience is identified, the key features of the app should be determined. The features should be designed in a way that they are easy to navigate and understand through semiotics.

1. **Develop the semiotics**: Develop a set of semiotics that are relevant to the target audience. These could include pictures, symbols, colors, and other visual cues that are easy to understand. Examples of generating semiotics include: 
    1. Sketching and drawing tools like pen and paper or with digital tools like a drawing tablet and software like Adobe Illustrator or Sketch.
    1. Icon libraries. Some popular icon libraries include Font Awesome, Material Icons, and Noun Project.
    1. Custom icon design services. Some examples of custom icon design services include Iconfinder and Iconscout.
    1. User-generated content: Another option is to involve the target audience in the development of the semiotics. This can be done through user-generated content, such as having users submit their own drawings or symbols that represent certain concepts or actions within the app. This can be a great way to create semiotics that are more culturally relevant and meaningful to the community being served.

1. **Design the user interface**: The user interface should be designed in a way that makes it easy to use for people with low literacy levels. The interface should include the semiotics and should be designed in a way that is easy to navigate. One can use a tool such as Figma (https://www.figma.com/) to aid in the creation of wireframes. 

1. **Test the app**: It's important to test the app with the target audience to ensure that the semiotics are understandable and that the app is easy to use. This can involve usability testing, focus groups, or user feedback surveys.

## Introduce Load Testing on the Talawa API

Introduce load testing on the API side to see if new features are practical. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about various new features that would make the app run faster and/or more scalable. If we had load tests to simulate a large number of requests we would have a better idea of how useful these features would actually be and if they fit our needs.

Here is a detailed guide on how to introduce load testing for such an API:

1. **Define the objectives**: Before beginning load testing, define the objectives of the test. This includes the number of requests that the API should be able to handle, the expected response times, and the maximum load that the API can handle. This information will be used to create the test scenarios and set the load thresholds.

1. **Choose a load testing tool**: There are several load testing tools available that can be used to test the API, such as Apache JMeter, Locust, and Gatling. Choose a tool that is compatible with Node.js and has support for GraphQL.

1. **Set up the load testing environment**: Set up the load testing environment by creating a test environment that is similar to the production environment. This includes setting up the same infrastructure, databases, and server configurations.

1. **Create test scenarios**: Create test scenarios that simulate real-world usage of the API. This includes simulating user behavior, such as registering, logging in, querying data, and posting data. Use the objectives defined in step 1 to determine the number of requests and the duration of the test.

1. **Configure the load testing tool**: Configure the load testing tool to execute the test scenarios. This includes setting the load thresholds, ramp-up times, and duration of the test.

1. **Execute the load test**: Execute the load test and monitor the results. This includes monitoring the response times, error rates, and server metrics. Analyze the results to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues.

1. **Optimize the API**: Based on the results of the load test, optimize the API by addressing any performance issues or bottlenecks that were identified. This includes optimizing the database queries, reducing the number of API calls, and improving server configurations.

1. **Repeat the load test**: After making the optimizations, repeat the load test to ensure that the performance has improved and that the API can handle the load.
